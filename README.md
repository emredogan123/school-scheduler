# 📅 School Scheduler

A web-based **school timetable generator** that automatically assigns courses to time slots while respecting real-world constraints such as teacher availability, classroom conflicts, and weekly lesson requirements.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Constraints
- Teachers can only be assigned to their **available time slots**
- A teacher **cannot teach multiple classes at the same time**
- A class group **cannot have overlapping lessons**
- Courses are scheduled based on **weekly required hours**

---

### 🧠 Scheduling Engine
- Constraint-based scheduling algorithm
- Handles **multi-class school planning**
- Detects and reports **conflicts automatically**

---

### 📊 UI Highlights
- Clean **grid-based timetable view**
- Organized by class (e.g., 10A, 10B)
- Each lesson shows:
  - Course name
  - Teacher
  - Class
- Conflict alerts displayed clearly
